# Sudoku-Solver-Backtracking-Algorithms-for-Puzzles-of-Every-Complexity
# Abstract:
Sudoku game is well famous and popular game among many players all over the world. This
report details the development of a Sudoku game application that is written in Java. The
application is even developed to work in Android systems.
In addition, the report details the implementation of the complexity of the algorithms used to
solve any kind of Sudoku puzzle. Also, how to generate a puzzle with different level of
difficulties and make sure there will be only one solution.
The aim of the report is also to discuss the backtracking, brute force algorithms and other logics
in order to create and solve Sudoku puzzles. Furthermore, the user-friendly environment is
considered in the report as the rules of Sudoku are connected to the interface.
Moreover, the report specifics how well these methods of solving solves the puzzle and
achieved the goal of this implementation. The report concludes by evaluating the end
application to analyse how good it met its objectives and the performance of solving
algorithms. Finally, the report summarises the overall achievements of the application
development and indicates other possible extensions.

# INTRODUCTION:
Originally, Sudoku is a Japanese puzzle game. It means "Single Number" or "Number Place".
The game consists of a 9x9 grid, which is divided into nine 3x3 grids (called boxes or subgrids). So, there are 9 rows and 9 columns. The intersection of a row and a column is called a
cell. The result of the total cells is 81. The objective is to fill the empty cells with only one
number from 1 to 9 in the shortest time. There are 3 rules in order to complete and accomplish
all of the empty cells:
1) The number must only occur in a column once.
2) The number must only occur in a row once.
3) The number must occur in a sub-grid only once.
Moreover, Sudoku is a popular and intellectually stimulating puzzle game that challenges one's
logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Many individuals, from novices to experienced
players, often seek efficient solutions to Sudoku puzzles. This project serves to fulfill that need
by providing an algorithmic tool for solving Sudoku puzzles. This means that the solution of
any puzzle should have one solution that is unique. The difficulty of the puzzle depends not
only how many numbers are given, but also on the placement of the given cells.
